1.  fstream provides the capability to both input and output data to the same file.  This capability allows for reading and writing to the same file, rather than creating an object to read, destroying it, creating and object to write, destroying it, etc.

2. To append to the end of a file, the file should be opened with ios::app.

3. When the code is run, a file object will be created with write access to the file and any content written to the file will overwrite previous content.  It is important to note that the data written to the file may not replace the file's contents until the file is closed depending on the underlying operating system's handling of file buffers.

4. To combine multiple file flags, use a single pipe character (|).

5. It is necessary to pass file handles by reference.
