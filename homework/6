#13: A reference to a class object is passed to the operator=.
#14: It should not be implemented as void, because then A=B=C would not function
     correctly.
#15: Postfix mode for ++ is identified by a dummy parameter of type int.
#16: The this pointer is a special pointer pointing to the class instance that
     called it.
#17: An overloaded relational operator should return type bool.
#18: copy, overloaded, overloaded, overloaded
#19: In order to make a member variable static, preface it with "static".
#20: In order to make a member function static, preface it with "static".
#21: 2 each of x and y exist, with one of z.
     x and y will each contain whatever was in z, random if z isn't initialized.
     Thing::putThing(0);
#22: In the case of object aggregation, one class exists as a member of another
     and no additional access exists for that class.  In the case of a friend
     of a class it allows the direct access to all private variables of the
     class to the friend.
#23: Forward declaring a class tells the compiler it is a type, so it can be
     referenced, but it isn't necessary to fully know the structure.
#24: Pointer members can be used to dynamically allocate memory.  In this case
     memberwise assignment would copy the pointer, but wouldn't allocate the
     memory that existed in the first object.
#25: When passed by value, the only function containing code to handle all
     variables in the class is the copy constructor.
