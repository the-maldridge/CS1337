Project 3 Psuedocode:

main program flow:
     init (create arrays and read in the answer files)
     process (iterate over student response and create answer mask)
     report (aggregate data and create output file)
     close (close file links and then exit)


init:
	open answer file
	read first line into tSize
	create a pointer based array of size tSize
	read the file in line by line (normalize to upper case)
	create a 2d array for the student answer file malloc(sizeof(int*)*tSize)
	read in the student answer file
	create a mask array the same size as the answer array of type int	
	create a scores array with size tSize

process:
	iterate over the response array and write true/false into the mask
		I'll use nested for loops
		I'll iterate over the pointer offsets
		the multiple arrays will be kept in sync by using the same index
	compute what the score for the test is and add it to the scores array
	
report:
	open an output file
	assemble each line of the file
		 first the name,
		 then the percentage, and a letter grade (determine with switch)
		 then the answers, justified to width 2 right/aligned using setw&right
		 then 2 newlines to add a blank line between students
	write each line into the file
	sync the file
	close the file

close:
	close all file handles
	deallocate memory from the pointer array (delete)
	exit the program
